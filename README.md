# Mac Media Key Forwarder

Mac Media Key Forwarder (MMKF) directly forwards media keys (play/pause, next, previous) to your preferred app. This prevents accidentally controlling the currently registered app with `MPRemoteCommandCenter`, e.g. a currently playing YouTube video.

You configure an ordered **whitelist** of apps that may receive media keys. **Prefer Now Playing** is **on** by default: MMKF follows the system Now Playing client when its bundle ID matches your list (via private Media Remote APIs). macOS may still log `kMRMediaRemoteFrameworkErrorDomain` / “Operation not permitted” in some environments (often under the debugger); that is usually noise unless routing actually misbehaves. Turn it off in **Targets & Settings** if you want routing from AppleScript “playing” state and list order only.

The app runs in the menu bar. Open **Targets & Settings…** (menu or **⌘,**) to edit the list, reorder entries, or add any application.

**User-added apps** (not one of the built-in players below) are driven with **Space** and **⌘←** / **⌘→** sent to that app’s process—similar to the Tidal fallback—so behaviour depends on the app. For a site like Audiobookshelf, install it as a **Safari “Add to Dock” web app** so it has a normal bundle ID you can add to the list.

**Now Playing** integration uses Apple’s private `MediaRemote.framework` (loaded with `dlopen` at runtime). If it breaks after an OS upgrade, turn off **Prefer Now Playing app when it is in the list** in settings.

**Play / pause memory:** the last app you controlled with **media keys** (play, pause, skip, etc.) is remembered so the next **Play** press targets that app again instead of jumping to whatever is first in the list. When **Now Playing** (Media Remote) settles on a **different whitelisted** app than that one—usually because you started playback from that app’s UI—the memory is cleared so keys follow the new client. Hardware play keys sometimes fire **repeat “down” events** without a release; MMKF ignores those repeats to avoid accidental double toggles.

Download the compiled application from my [Releases](https://github.com/quppi/macmediakeyforwarder/releases).

## Supported Applications

- [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/)
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com)
- [Tidal](https://www.tidal.com)
- [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com)

## Issues you should know about

The app listens on the event tap for key events. This causes problems in some rare cases, like

- when changing search engine in Safari's preferences window
- when trying to allow third-party kernel extensions

In these cases simply pause MMKF from it's menu.

### Deezer support

Deezer doesn't expose playback controls via the Apple ScriptingBridge. Play / Pause is controlled through sending virtual key events (spacebar) to the running process directly. This doesn't work for next / previous track functionality, as these are implemented through Electron menu accelerators. Their codepath however is only triggered, when the appwindow is active (in the foreground).

As a solution, MMKF restarts Deezer with the Chrome DevTools Protocol enabled (`--remote-debugging-port`). This allows MMKF to access the Deezer `window.dzPlayer.control` object through a websocket and control playback this way.

This websocket is only accessible from localhost and not exposed to the internet. However any locally running app could in theory access it.

## Installation & Compatibility prior to Sonoma

For macOS versions prior to Sonoma please use the [original fork](https://github.com/quentinlesceller/macmediakeyforwarder) by Quentin Lesceller.

If your mac displays the following error message when you try to open the app

```
macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware
```

you can disable the gatekeeper security check with the following command in the terminal:

```
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/MacMediaKeyForwarder.app
```

`! note:` adjust the path to the app if it's located in a different location

The app itself is compatible with Sonoma or later, but you need to add it as trusted application in order to make it function properly.

You can do this with these steps:

1. Go to **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy**
2. Go to **Accessibility**
3. Turn on the checkbox for **MacMediaKeyForwarder.app**
4. Go back and go to **Automation**
5. Turn on the checkbox for **Music.app** and **Spotifiy.app** under **MacMediaKeyForwarder.app**
6. Run the app again
