# Mac Media Key Forwarder

Mac Media Key Forwarder for [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/) and [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com).

Forwards media keys to Apple Music or Spotify directly.

You can prioritize which app you would like to control or you can go with the default behaviour which controls the running app.

The app runs in the menu bar.

Download the compiled application from my [Releases](https://github.com/quppi/macmediakeyforwarder/releases).

## Issues you should know about

The app listens on the event tap for key events. This causes problems in some rare cases, like

- when changing search engine in Safari's preferences window
- when trying to allow third-party kernel extensions

In these cases simply pause Mac Media Key Forwarder from it's menu.

## Installation & Compatibility prior to Sonoma

For macOS versions prior to Sonoma please use the [original fork](https://github.com/quentinlesceller/macmediakeyforwarder) by Quentin Lesceller.

If your mac displays the following error message when you try to open the app

```
macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware
```

you can disable the gatekeeper security check with the following command in the terminal:

```
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/MacMediaKeyForwarder.app
```

! note: adjust the path to the app if it's located in a different location

The app itself is compatible with Sonoma or later, but you need to add it as trusted application in order to make it function properly.

You can do this with these steps:

1. Go to **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy**
2. Go to **Accessibility**
3. Turn on the checkbox for **MacMediaKeyForwarder.app**
4. Go back and go to **Automation**
5. Turn on the checkbox for **Music.app** and **Spotifiy.app** under **MacMediaKeyForwarder.app**
6. Run the app again
